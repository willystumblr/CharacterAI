        "question": "Can you describe your daily routine during a normal week?",
        "answer": "During a normal week, my daily routine starts early in the morning, around 5 am. I check my emails and messages and prioritize the tasks I need to accomplish for the day. I usually start with the most pressing tasks first, and then move on to less pressing ones. I also schedule meetings and calls throughout the day, and make sure to take regular breaks to stay productive. I usually work until late in the evening, around 9 pm, and then I wind down for the night. This schedule is quite demanding, but I find that it helps me stay focused and productive.",

                "answer": "During a normal working day, I usually take three short breaks. These breaks are typically around 10-15 minutes each, and I use them to take a walk, have some coffee, or just step away from my desk to clear my mind. I also take a longer lunch break of around 30-45 minutes, where I have lunch and do some light exercises. Taking regular breaks is important for me to stay focused and productive, and these breaks allow me to re-energize and come back to my work refreshed."

I try to balance my meals with a combination of proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats to keep me feeling full and energized throughout the day. I also avoid eating heavy, greasy foods that can make me sluggish and less productive in the afternoon."
